1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,520
To create an effective text

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:03,080
prompt for text-to-speech,

3
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:05,280
TTS, it's important to use

4
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,700
clear and concise language

5
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:08,100
that mimics natural speech

6
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:09,740
patterns. Structure your

7
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,200
sentences in a way that allows

8
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,700
for smooth intonation and

9
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:14,940
pacing. Avoid overly complex

10
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,980
sentences or jargon that might

11
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,580
confuse the TTS engine. Use

12
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:20,900
punctuation strategically,

13
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,400
commas, periods, and question

14
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,980
marks, help guide the rhythm

15
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:26,980
of speech. If you need to

16
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:28,200
emphasize certain words,

17
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,240
consider using capitalization

18
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,900
or punctuation like dashes or

19
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,380
ellipses for pauses. Lastly,

20
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,280
ensure that the text is free

21
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,840
from spelling errors or

22
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,320
abbreviations that could be

23
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,440
mispronounced. By following

24
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,220
these tips, you'll enhance the

25
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:45,800
clarity and natural flow of

26
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,640
the speech output.
